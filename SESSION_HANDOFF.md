## Previous: App Icon + Dock Menu (2026-01-19 12:55 PM)

### App Icon Created ✅
**Issue:** Dock showed generic Xcode icon - AppIcon.appiconset had empty slots
**Fix:** Created `sanehosts-icon.svg` following Sane Apps brand template:
- Dark blue gradient background (`#1a2744` → `#0d1525`)
- Cyan network/globe symbol (`#5fa8d3`) with glow effect
- Generated all required PNG sizes (16x16 through 512x512@2x)
- Updated Contents.json with filename references

**Files:**
- Source SVG: `/Users/sj/SaneApps/meta/Brand/Assets/sanehosts-icon.svg`
- Icons: `SaneHosts/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

### Dock Menu Added ✅
**Issue:** Right-clicking dock icon had no Settings option
**Fix:** Added `AppDelegate` with `applicationDockMenu()` method
- Settings... (Cmd+,) - Opens Settings window
- Open SaneHosts - Brings app to front

**Location:** `SaneHostsApp.swift` - AppDelegate class

---

## Previous: Menu Bar State Sync Fix (2026-01-19 12:45 PM)

### Menu Bar Fixes ✅
**Issues Found:**
1. MenuBarProfileStore created separate ProfileStore instance (state never synced)
2. Deactivate didn't update ProfileStore state
3. Silent error handling (try?) - users never saw failures
4. Dead code (MenuBarManager.swift) cluttering codebase

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added `ProfileStore.shared` singleton for app-wide state sharing
2. MenuBarProfileStore now uses shared store with 1-second polling sync
3. Added proper error display in menu bar UI
4. Removed unused MenuBarManager.swift
5. Changed accent color from teal → indigo (distinct from blue)

**Location:** `SaneHostsApp.swift`, `ProfileStore.swift`

---

## Previous: Critical Bug Fixes (2026-01-19)

### 1. Data Loss Prevention ✅
**Issue:** On first run, existing user entries in `/etc/hosts` were not imported, leading to data loss when activating any profile.
**Fix:** Added `migrateExistingSystemHosts()` to `ProfileStore.swift`. On first run, the app now creates an "Existing Entries" profile containing all user-defined hosts entries.
**Location:** `ProfileStore.swift` lines 115-142

### 2. IP Filtering Bug Fixed ✅
**Issue:** `RemoteSyncService` hardcoded a filter for `0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1`, silently rejecting valid hosts entries with other IPs (e.g., `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`).
**Fix:** Replaced the hardcoded check with `HostsParser.isValidIPAddress()` to allow any valid IP.
**Location:** `RemoteSyncService.swift` lines 179-182

### 3. Bulk Operations Performance ✅
**Issue:** Bulk enable/disable/delete operations performed serial disk writes (one per entry), causing severe lag on large profiles.
**Fix:** Added `bulkUpdateEntries(ids:in:update:)` and `bulkRemoveEntries(ids:from:)` methods to `ProfileStore`. Refactored `ProfileDetailView` to use them for single-write operations.
**Location:** `ProfileStore.swift` lines 467-498, `ProfileDetailView.swift` lines 496-520

### 4. Independent Verification (12:30 PM)
All fixes audited and verified. Two additional issues found and fixed during verification:
1. **Missed Atomic Write:** `createRemote` in `ProfileStore` was not using `.atomic` option - FIXED
2. **Parser Hoisting:** `RemoteSyncService` was creating 100K+ `HostsParser` instances per import - FIXED
- **Test Result:** 43/43 unit tests passed

## Previous: URL Liveness Checking + Auto-Naming Fix

### 1. Fixed Broken Blocklist URLs
OISD discontinued HOSTS format on Jan 1, 2024. Fixed 6 broken URLs:
| Original | Issue | Replacement |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| OISD Basic | 404 | Hagezi Light |
| OISD NSFW | 404 | Anti-Porn HOSTS |
| First-Party Trackers | 404 | NextDNS CNAME Cloaking |
| Polish Ads Filter | 404 | Removed |
| Japanese Ads Filter | 403 | Removed |
| Korean Ads Filter | Mislabeled | Renamed to "No Google" |

### 2. URL Liveness Preflight Check (NEW)
When Import Blocklist sheet opens:
- Parallel HEAD requests check all ~45 URLs
- Shows "Checking URLs..." spinner in header
- ✓ Green badge for available sources
- ⚠️ Red badge + error code for unavailable
- Broken sources are grayed out and unselectable
- Header shows count of unavailable sources

### 3. Smart Auto-Naming for Combined Blocklists
Profile names now generated descriptively:
- 2-3 sources: `"Steven Black + Hagezi + Peter Lowe"`
- 4+ sources: `"Steven Black + 4 more"`

**Location:** `MainView.swift` - RemoteImportSheet, `BlocklistCatalog.swift`

## Completed This Session (2026-01-19)

### 1. New Feature: Hide Dock Icon ✅
- **Setting**: Added "Hide Dock icon" toggle in General Settings.
- **Config**: Updated `LSUIElement = YES` (Accessory mode).
- **Logic**: Implemented robust activation policy switching at runtime with lockout prevention (forces Menu Bar icon if Dock icon is hidden).

### 2. Full Menu System Audit & Fixes ✅
- **Settings Access**: Fixed critical bug where "Settings..." was unresponsive from Dock/Menu Bar. Implemented robust `NotificationCenter` based launcher (`SettingsLauncher`).
- **Dock Menu**: Verified and wired "Open SaneHosts" and "Settings".
- **System Menu**: Added "New Profile" (Cmd+N), "Import Blocklist" (Cmd+I), and "Deactivate All" (Cmd+Shift+D).
- **Shortcuts**: Implemented all missing shortcuts and removed dead code.

### 3. Performance & Stability ✅
- **Blocking I/O Fixed**: Refactored `ProfileStore` to load/parse on background threads (`Task.detached`), preventing launch hangs.
- **Dead Code**: Removed unused `DownloadProgressDelegate`.
- **Launch Crash**: Fixed crash on launch by adding `disable-library-validation` entitlement for Hardened Runtime compatibility.

### 4. Custom URL Import ✅
- Verified via integration test. Works for single and multiple hostname entries.

### 5. Infrastructure ✅
- **.gitignore**: Added `build/` exclusion.
- **Code Signing**: Added entitlements for local debug with Hardened Runtime.

### 1. UI Visibility Improvements (Dark Mode) ✅
- **Add Entry button**: Orange icon (distinct from blue/teal), `.subheadline` text
- **Last Fetched**: Readable `.primary.opacity(0.8)` text, larger FreshnessIndicator badge
- **StatCard icons**: Better color differentiation
- **Activate/Deactivate buttons**: Parity with `.borderedProminent` style

### 2. Color Semantics Finalized ✅
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Blue** | Web/URL/remote content |
| **Orange** | Actions, call-to-action |
| **Green** | Active status ONLY |
| **Indigo** | App accent (saneAccent) - changed from teal |
| **Purple** | Merged profiles |
| **Red** | Destructive |

### 3. Import Blocklist Audit ✅
Full audit completed. Key findings:
- **50+ curated blocklists** in 10 categories
- **Auto-naming logic exists** but wasn't filling the field (now fixed)
- **Deduplication** works via hostname matching
- **Entry limit**: 500K entries (increased from 10K)
- **Profile refresh**: Source URL stored but no update mechanism yet

### 4. Previous Fixes ✅
- Multi-select delete from context menu
- Merge profiles auto-naming (generateMergedName)
- Profile copy naming ("Default 1", "Default 2")
- Entry cap increased to 500K

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build
xcodebuild -workspace SaneHosts.xcworkspace -scheme SaneHosts -configuration Debug -arch arm64 build

# Launch with logging (SOP)
killall -9 SaneHosts 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
open "/Users/sj/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SaneHosts-dflfxnlekfyjpqbckkiubgayrxgw/Build/Products/Debug/SaneHosts.app"

# Clear profiles
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/SaneHosts/Profiles/*.json
