SaneHosts is a native macOS app that makes managing your `/etc/hosts` file simple and intuitive. Choose a protection level, activate it, done. No Terminal. No commands. If something breaks, just deactivate.

## Features

### Protection Levels
Choose from 5 curated protection levels - each bundles the right blocklists for your needs:

| Level | What It Blocks |
|-------|---------------|
| **Essentials** | Ads, trackers, malware - the basics everyone needs |
| **Balanced** | Essentials + phishing, fraud, aggressive tracking |
| **Strict** | Balanced + social media trackers, native telemetry |
| **Aggressive** | Strict + gambling, piracy, adult content |
| **Kitchen Sink** | Everything available - maximum blocking |

### Core Features
- **Profile Management** - Create and manage multiple hosts configurations with color tagging
- **200+ Curated Blocklists** - Import from Steven Black, Hagezi, AdGuard, OISD, and 10+ categories
- **Guided Setup** - Coach mark tutorial walks you through activation on first launch
- **Remote Import** - Import hosts from any URL or paste custom blocklist URLs
- **Merge Profiles** - Combine multiple profiles with automatic deduplication
- **Automatic DNS Flush** - DNS cache cleared when activating profiles
- **Menu Bar Access** - Quick profile switching from the menu bar
- **Crash Resilient** - Automatic backups (3 per profile), corrupted profiles recovered automatically
- **Native macOS** - Built with SwiftUI, follows system conventions
- **Privacy-First** - All data stored locally, no analytics, no cloud
- **Export Profiles** - Save profiles as standard `.hosts` format files
- **Drag to Reorder** - Organize profiles by dragging in the sidebar
- **Search & Filter** - Find entries across large profiles (handles 100K+ entries)
- **URL Health Checks** - Visual indicators show blocklist source availability
