# SaneHosts Session Log

## Session Summary - 2026-01-19 (FIX SESSION)

### Root Cause Identified & Fixed

**The blank UI was caused by the app sandbox preventing access to `/etc/hosts`.**

In `ProfileStore.load()`, the call to `loadSystemHosts()` reads `/etc/hosts`:
```swift
let content = try String(contentsOf: systemHostsURL, encoding: .utf8)  // /etc/hosts
```

With sandbox enabled, this throws a permission error. The error was caught but caused `loadProfiles()` to be skipped, resulting in an empty `profiles` array and blank UI.

### Fix Applied

**File:** `Config/SaneHosts.entitlements`

Changed:
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>
```

To:
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<false/>
```

The app requires unsandboxed access to:
1. Read `/etc/hosts` for system entries
2. Write to `/etc/hosts` for profile activation (via AppleScript with admin privileges)

### Verification

After rebuilding with sandbox disabled:
- ✅ App launches correctly
- ✅ Profiles load and display in sidebar
- ✅ Adding entries works and UI updates immediately (BUG-001 fix confirmed working)
- ✅ Entry shows in detail view with correct stats

### BUG-001 Status

The UI reactivity bug (selectedProfile not updating) was **already fixed** in the codebase:
- `MainView.swift` now uses `selectedProfileID: UUID?` with a computed `selectedProfile` property
- This ensures fresh data is always fetched from the store

### Files Modified This Session

- `Config/SaneHosts.entitlements` - Disabled sandbox

### SOP Compliance: 9/10
- ✅ Read error messages and logs carefully
- ✅ Investigated root cause before attempting fixes
- ✅ Made minimal targeted change (single file)
- ✅ Verified fix with UI testing
- ⚠️ Could have checked entitlements earlier (was in CLAUDE.md notes)

## Previous Session - 2026-01-18

### What Was Attempted
- Rewrote RemoteSyncService to use URLSessionDownloadDelegate for progress tracking
- Added ImportPhase enum for tracking download/parse phases
- Added "Downloaded" badge for already-imported sources in RemoteImportSheet
- Added createRemote() method to ProfileStore
- Simplified download to use basic URLSession.shared.download()

### Files Modified
- RemoteSyncService.swift - multiple rewrites, currently has unused DownloadProgressDelegate class
- MainView.swift - added isSourceDownloaded() helper, FetchProgressOverlay with phase-based display
- ProfileStore.swift - added createRemote() method, added debug logging
